# Awesome Secure MCP Servers [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> **Secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** with automated security validation, vulnerability scanning, and tool poisoning detection. Browse 16+ vetted MCP servers for building secure agentic AI systems.

## 🛡️ Security-First MCP Server Directory

Find **secure MCP servers** for your agentic AI applications with confidence. Model Context Protocol is the USB-C of building agentic systems - providing standardized, secure connections between AI agents and external tools. Each server undergoes automated security scanning including dependency vulnerability checks, static analysis, and MCP-specific threat detection (tool poisoning, cross-origin attacks).

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Browse servers** by category below
2. **Check security status** - look for 🛡️ Verified Secure or ⚠️ Conditional ratings
3. **Review scores** - higher scores indicate better security posture
4. **Follow repository links** for installation instructions

### 📊 Security Status Legend
- **🛡️ Verified Secure** (85-100): Comprehensive validation passed
- **⚠️ Conditional** (70-84): Secure with specific configuration requirements  
- **⏳ Awaiting Scan**: Repository currently inaccessible for scanning
- **❌ Not Recommended** (0-49): Known security issues
