# Awesome Secure MCP Servers [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with comprehensive security validation using the `mcp-scan` security assessment pipeline.

## Mission

This project provides transparent, reproducible security assessments of MCP servers using automated scanning tools to help developers make informed decisions about MCP server security.

## Transparency

All assessment components are publicly available:
- [Scan results](./security/) are published
- [Security scanning tools](./scripts/) are open source
- [Raw security data](./data/servers.json) is machine-readable
- [GitHub Actions workflows](./.github/workflows/) run publicly
- [Detailed methodology](./security/README.md) is documented

## Community Involvement

Help improve this project:
- **Found an error?** [Open an issue](../../issues/new)
- **Disagree with an assessment?** [Start a discussion](../../discussions)
- **Suggest improvements?** [Submit a PR](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Security expert?** [Join our review process](./CONTRIBUTING.md#manual-security-review)

## Limitations

### What we do:
- Run automated security scans using `mcp-scan` by Invariant Labs for MCP-specific threats
- Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies using language-specific tools
- Detect common security anti-patterns with static analysis
- Identify MCP-specific vulnerabilities including tool poisoning, cross-origin escalation, and rug pull attacks
- Provide reproducible, version-specific assessments with detailed scoring

### What we don't do:
- Guarantee security (no tool can do this)
- Test runtime behavior or complex attack scenarios
- Audit cryptographic implementations in detail
- Check for zero-day vulnerabilities
- Replace your own security assessment

### Security Assessment Process

**Automated Scanning:**
- **MCP Security Scan**: Using `mcp-scan` for MCP-specific threats (tool poisoning, cross-origin escalation, rug pulls)
- **Static Analysis**: Code patterns and potential vulnerabilities using language-specific tools
- **Dependency Scanning**: Known CVEs in third-party packages  
- **Container Security**: Dockerfile and image analysis when applicable

**Manual Review:**
- Architecture and design review
- Authentication/authorization assessment
- Documentation quality evaluation
- Security best practices compliance

**Scoring Method:**
- Weighted combination of scan results: MCP Security (35%), Dependencies (25%), Static Analysis (20%), Container (10%), Documentation (10%)
- Scores are indicative, not definitive
- Multiple reviewers for subjective assessments (see [review team](./REVIEWERS.md))
- See [detailed methodology](./security/README.md) for complete scoring breakdown

## Legend

- **Verified Secure**: Passed comprehensive security validation
- **Conditional**: Secure with specific configuration requirements  
- **Under Review**: Currently undergoing security validation
- **Not Recommended**: Known security issues
- **Version**: Latest validated secure version

## Critical Disclaimers

### Security Assessment Limitations
This list provides security indicators, not guarantees:

- **Automated scans** catch common issues but miss complex vulnerabilities
- **Manual reviews** are subjective and limited by reviewer expertise  
- **No runtime testing** - we don't test actual MCP server behavior
- **No penetration testing** - we don't attempt to exploit vulnerabilities
- **No guarantees** - security status can change at any time

### Your Responsibility
You must still:
- Perform your own security assessment for production use
- Keep servers updated and monitor for new vulnerabilities
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper monitoring and incident response

## How to Help

### Review Our Work
- **Challenge our assessments** - if you disagree, tell us why
- **Audit our tools** - all scanning code is open source
- **Verify our data** - check scan results against actual repositories
- **Test our methodology** - try our tools on servers you know well

### Get Involved
- **Join discussions** on security assessment methodology
- **Submit servers** for community review
- **Contribute code** to improve our scanning tools
- **Share expertise** through manual security reviews

### Report Issues
- **Assessment errors** - wrong security status or score
- **Missing servers** - suggest additions with justification
- **Tool bugs** - problems with our scanning scripts
- **Process improvements** - better ways to assess security
