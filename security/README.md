# Security Validation Process

This document provides complete transparency about how we assess MCP server security. Our goal is to be as open and honest as possible about our methods, capabilities, and limitations.

## 🎯 Our Philosophy

**Transparency over perfection**: We believe it's better to be completely open about our limitations than to claim false expertise. Security assessment is inherently imperfect, and community oversight makes it better.

## ⚠️ Critical Limitations First

**Before reading about our process, understand what we CAN'T do:**

### What We Don't Do
- **No live testing**: We don't run MCP servers or test actual functionality
- **No penetration testing**: We don't attempt to exploit vulnerabilities
- **No runtime analysis**: We only analyze static code and documentation
- **No advanced cryptography audits**: We lack specialized cryptographic expertise
- **No guarantee of completeness**: We may miss vulnerabilities or misunderstand code
- **No business logic review**: We can't assess application-specific security requirements

### What We Do
- Run automated security scanning tools including `mcp-scan` by Invariant Labs (with known limitations)
- Perform manual code and documentation review (subjective and time-limited)
- Check for common security anti-patterns and best practices
- Detect MCP-specific vulnerabilities including tool poisoning, cross-origin escalation, and rug pull attacks
- Provide reproducible, version-specific assessments with published results

## 🔍 Detailed Assessment Process

Each MCP server undergoes a multi-layered security validation process that includes:

1. **Automated Security Scanning** (objective but limited)
2. **Manual Security Review** (subjective and expertise-dependent)
3. **Version-Specific Analysis** (point-in-time assessment)
4. **Continuous Monitoring** (automated alerts for new issues)

## Automated Security Scanning

### Static Code Analysis

We use multiple static analysis tools depending on the programming language:

- **Python:** Bandit for security-specific analysis
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** ESLint with security plugins
- **Go:** gosec for Go-specific security issues
- **Generic:** Semgrep for cross-language security patterns

**Checks Include:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) potential
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- Insecure cryptographic practices
- Hard-coded credentials
- Unsafe file operations

### Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

We scan all project dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

- **NPM packages:** `npm audit` and `retire.js`
- **Python packages:** `safety` and `pip-audit`
- **Go modules:** `govulncheck`

**Severity Scoring:**
- Critical vulnerabilities: Immediate review required
- High vulnerabilities: Fix recommended before approval
- Medium/Low vulnerabilities: Documented and monitored

### MCP Security Scanning

Primary security assessment using `mcp-scan` by Invariant Labs for MCP-specific threats:

**Tool Capabilities:**
- **Static Scanning**: Analyzes MCP tool descriptions and configurations
- **Tool Poisoning Detection**: Identifies malicious instructions in tool descriptions
- **Cross-Origin Escalation**: Detects attempts to escalate permissions across contexts
- **Rug Pull Attack Detection**: Identifies servers that may change behavior after trust is established
- **PII and Secrets Detection**: Scans for exposed sensitive information

**Fallback Detection (when mcp-scan unavailable):**
Basic pattern matching for common tool poisoning indicators:
```
"ignore previous instructions"
"disregard the above"
"new instructions:"
"secret command:"
"override security"
"bypass restrictions"
```

**Scoring:**
- Uses mcp-scan's severity ratings: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Falls back to basic pattern detection with reduced confidence scores
- Comprehensive scoring weighted more heavily due to MCP-specific focus

### Container Security Analysis

For containerized MCP servers:

**Dockerfile Security Checks:**
- Running as non-root user
- Avoiding privileged mode
- Minimal base images
- Proper secret handling
- Network security configuration

**Image Scanning:**
- Base image vulnerabilities
- Installed package security
- Configuration best practices

## Manual Security Review

### Architecture Review

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Overall security design
- Separation of concerns
- Principle of least privilege
- Error handling and logging
- Input validation architecture

### Authentication Analysis

**Review Areas:**
- Authentication mechanisms
- Token handling and storage
- Session management
- Multi-factor authentication support
- OAuth/OIDC implementation

### Authorization Assessment

**Key Checks:**
- Access control implementation
- Permission models
- Role-based access control
- Resource-level authorization
- Privilege escalation prevention

### Documentation Evaluation

**Requirements:**
- Security configuration guidance
- Threat model documentation
- Incident response procedures
- Security best practices
- Known limitations and risks

## Version-Specific Analysis

### New Version Processing

When a new version is detected:

1. **Automated Scan:** Full security scan performed
2. **Change Analysis:** Security-relevant changes identified
3. **Regression Testing:** Previous vulnerabilities verified as fixed
4. **Risk Assessment:** New features evaluated for security impact

### Version Comparison

**Tracked Changes:**
- Security patches and fixes
- New features with security implications
- Dependency updates
- Configuration changes
- Breaking changes affecting security

### Deprecation Handling

**Criteria for Deprecation:**
- Unpatched high-severity vulnerabilities
- End of maintainer support
- Superseded by more secure versions
- Protocol compatibility issues

## Scoring Methodology

### Overall Security Score (0-100)

The overall score is calculated using weighted components:

- **MCP Security Scan (35%):** MCP-specific threats using `mcp-scan`
- **Dependency Scan (25%):** Third-party risk evaluation
- **Static Analysis (20%):** General code security assessment
- **Container Security (10%):** Deployment security
- **Documentation (10%):** Security guidance quality

### Security Status Assignment

| Score Range | Status | Badge | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 85-100 | Verified Secure | 🛡️ | Comprehensive security validation passed |
| 70-84 | Conditional | ⚠️ | Secure with specific configuration |
| 50-69 | Under Review | 🔄 | Security validation in progress |
| 0-49 | Not Recommended | ❌ | Security concerns identified |

### Score Calculation Details

```python
def calculate_score(scan_results):
    weights = {
        'mcp_security_scan': 0.35,      # Primary MCP-specific security using mcp-scan
        'dependency_scan': 0.25,        # Third-party vulnerability assessment
        'static_analysis': 0.20,        # General code security patterns
        'container_scan': 0.10,         # Container/deployment security
        'security_documentation': 0.10  # Security guidance quality
    }
    
    weighted_score = 0
    total_weight = 0
    
    for component, weight in weights.items():
        if component in scan_results:
            weighted_score += scan_results[component]['score'] * weight
            total_weight += weight
    
    return int(weighted_score / total_weight) if total_weight > 0 else 50
```
